# Express.js Starter Pack

This is a starter pack for building web applications using Express.js framework. It comes pre-configured with essential dependencies and a basic project structure to help you get started quickly.

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version >= 12)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Starting the Application

To start the Express.js application, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the server and you should see a message in the console saying "Server started on port 3000" (assuming you have set the `PORT` variable to 3000 in your `.env` file).

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can access the application by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. You can modify the default route and add your own routes in the `index.js` file located in the root directory.

## Scripts

This starter pack comes with some predefined scripts in the `package.json` file:

- `npm start`: Starts the Express.js application using `nodemon` for automatic restarts on file changes.
- `npm test`: Runs the test suite for the application (placeholder script).

## Dependencies

This starter pack includes the following dependencies:

- `body-parser`: Parse incoming request bodies in a middleware.
- `cookie-parser`: Parse HTTP request cookies.
- `cors`: Enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for your application.
- `dotenv`: Load environment variables from a `.env` file.
- `express`: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- `express-mongo-sanitize`: Sanitize user-supplied data to prevent MongoDB operator injection.
- `express-rate-limit`: Enable rate limiting for your API endpoints.
- `helmet`: Add various HTTP headers to enhance security.
- `hpp`: Protect against HTTP Parameter Pollution attacks.
- `jsonwebtoken`: JSON Web Token (JWT) implementation for authentication.
- `mongoose`: MongoDB object modeling tool.
- `multer`: Middleware for handling `multipart/form-data` (file uploads).
- `mysql`: MySQL database driver for Node.js.
- `nodemon`: Monitor for changes in your application and automatically restart the server.
- `xss-clean`: Sanitize user input to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

Please refer to the official documentation for each dependency to learn more about their usage and configuration.
